## Component A: Staff Interview

### Interview Notes

The current return process starts when Maason and Kevin set up a table on the third floor. Student teams arrive one at a time and Maason goes through a return checklist item by item, asking each team whether they have a given item to return. When a team confirms they have something, Maason marks it off the checklist. After all items from a team are verified, Maason and Kevin divide everything into three categories: items that belong to IT inventory, items that belong to the makerspace, and items that should be discarded because they were consumed as part of a prototype or are otherwise not worth keeping.

Any item going into inventory needs a barcode sticker applied. GIX uses pre-generated eight digit barcodes from a roll of stickers issued by the University of Washington. Once a sticker is on the item, Maason or Kevin enters it into BlueTally, the asset tracking software that GIX uses to manage equipment checkouts. BlueTally does support CSV import, but Maason rarely uses it for the return process because item names in the checklist come directly from Amazon product listings and are too long and messy. He wants short clean names like "Hollyland Mars M2 Wireless Mic" rather than a full Amazon description stuffed into a title field. Cleaning up those names one by one is a friction point that makes batch CSV import impractical right now.

On top of the returned purchased items, Maason also needs to check back in any items that were individually borrowed from BlueTally during the year. So on return day a team might have both purchased items to hand back and borrowed items to check in, and Maason handles both at the same table.

I think the core pain is not just that the process is slow, but that it requires too many manual transitions: cross reference the checklist, make a category judgment, find and apply a barcode, then re enter the item into BlueTally. Each of those is a separate step with no system connecting them.

### Build Mandate

> "Based on the interview, I will build an equipment return tracker because Maason said going through every item one by one and re-entering it all into BlueTally takes too long, which means the app needs to speed up the check-in step and output data in a format ready for BlueTally import."
